# The following are the features and functions of the websites
###### ***To make the website appear more professional, the following features, which may seem simple and lack technical sophistication, have been included to enrich the content and improve its overall presentation.***

## 1. Multi-Language

> This site supports switching between different languages. The browser language will be set as the default language when you visit for the first time.

The languages ​​currently supported by this site are as follows:

1. 中文
2. English

## 2. Routing in Static Websites

> All path accesses are controlled and processed by `route.js`, which mimics the behavior of the backend system for path control.

*You can view the code of `[route.js](/JavaScript/General/route.js)` here, or visit [GitHub](https://github.com/SeeChen/seechen.github.io/blob/main/JavaScript/General/route.js) to view the implementation of the code. *

## 3. Pseudo Dynamic Website

> All data is stored as static files (e.g., JSON, TXT, etc.) in a GitHub repository. The content is fetched and parsed only when the relevant data is accessed, simulating a front-end and back-end interaction.
