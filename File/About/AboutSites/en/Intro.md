This website is hosted on Github Pages (github.io) and developed using HTML5 + CSS3 + Native JavaScript.

It is a Single Page Application (SPA), with all code available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/SeeChen/seechen.github.io/). All of the implementation has been independently completed by the author. While no open-source libraries were directly used, certain solutions were adapted from forum discussions and optimized for the websiteâ€™s specific logic (some optimizations might still require refinement). Additionally, AI tools were occasionally leveraged to assist with code improvements and debugging.

The repository for this project was initially created on August 25, 2021, and has recently undergone significant updates.

This website serves as a personal challenge for the author to explore and understand modern JavaScript and CSS features. The current objective is to develop and maintain the entire website solely with native JavaScript and CSS, without relying on any frameworks or external libraries.

If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, please feel free to visit my Github repository and submit an Issue. Your feedback and support would be greatly appreciated!
