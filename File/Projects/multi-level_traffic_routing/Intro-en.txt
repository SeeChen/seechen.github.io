  With the increasing complexity of urban transportation networks and the dynamic nature of vertices in real-world scenarios, traditional path planning algorithms exhibit significant limitations in terms of efficiency and adaptability. This paper delves into the shortcomings of existing algorithms and proposes an innovative algorithm designed to address these limitations while enhancing overall path planning performance.
  Traditional path planning algorithms typically require loading the entire graph, which becomes highly inefficient when dealing with large, dynamically changing graphs. The algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively find the shortest path in a dynamically changing graph without loading the entire graph. Moreover, this algorithm introduces an adjustable parameter that allows for intervention and adjustment of the output results without altering the core architecture, thereby increasing the algorithm's flexibility and practicality.
  To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, it was applied to the path planning of a multi-level public transportation network system. The algorithm performed well in the complex multi-level public transportation network system, accurately identifying the optimal path and demonstrating higher efficiency and stronger adaptability in handling dynamically changing graphs.
  People's travel needs in daily life are diverse. Existing path planning algorithms often fail to meet users' personalized needs. These algorithms primarily pursue short paths, neglecting users' individual preferences. To address these needs, specific constraints were added to the designed algorithm, allowing travel users more options. These constraints can be adjusted according to user preferences, providing more tailored path planning solutions.
  By introducing these personalized constraints, the algorithm not only finds the optimal path but also provides travel solutions that better meet users' actual needs in various scenarios. This flexibility allows the algorithm to perform excellently in various complex transportation networks.
  This study not only aims to solve the current shortcomings of path planning algorithms but also hopes to provide new ideas for travel planning in public transportation networks through this innovative algorithm. With the development of cities and the advancement of smart city construction, this algorithm can also offer more scientific and reasonable suggestions for urban transportation planning, improving the overall traffic efficiency and travel experience of residents.
